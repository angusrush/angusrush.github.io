ROUGH DRAFT -- I hope to add some hand-drawn illustrations.

This blog will be dedicated to whatever I feel like writing about on any given
week. This will likely be some combination of research notes, musings on
category theory (especially basic category theory) and physics, and even some
more far out stuff, like baking or cooking. The emphasis will be on quantity
over quality---I want to write something at least every other week, no matter
how small. Any research notes I write will probably be incomprehensible to
anyone other than me and (if I'm having a good day) my advisor.

My research is, broadly speaking, about homotopy theory, more specifically
higher category theory. For tax purposes, that makes me a topologist, although
I never formally learned any point-set topology, and my intuition is pretty
much useless outside of things which are at least as nice as CW complexes. I'm
really more of a category theory fanboy.

Category theory has been fairly fashionable recently, and there is a lot of
effort going into making it easy to understand and teach. A lot of the current
teaching methods follow the historical development of category theory, treating
categories are structured containers for algebraic data: we think of the
objects in our category as abstracted algebraic gadgets of some sort; sets,
groups, rings, or whatever; the morphisms are then abstractions of maps between
them. I think there's a lot to gain by the homotopy-theoretic point of view:
categories are simultaneously a generalization of, and a special case of,
topological spaces.  For me, many things in category theory lose a lot of their
mystery when viewed this way, and there's a lot to be gained by playing these
two points of view off each other.

My next blog post will be a concrete example of this: the
definition of a natural transformation. The first definitions one is confronted
with when one studies categories are (1) categories themselves, and (2)
functors between categories. Both of these are easily digestible: anyone who is
learning about categories presumably wants to know what a category is, so the
definition of a category motivates itself. The definition of a functor is then
completely natural: functors are the structure-preserving maps between
categories. This fits in well with the way category theory presented.
